# As you may know, once women pass their teens, they should only be celebrated for their 20th or 21st birthday, forever. With some maths skills, that's totally possible - you only need to select the correct number base!

# For example, if she turns 32, that's exactly 20 - in base 16... Already 39? That's just 21, in base 19!

# Your task is to translate the given age to the much desired 20 (or 21) years, and indicate the number base, in the format specified below.

# Note: input will be always > 21

# Examples:
# 32  -->  "32? That's just 20, in base 16!"
# 39  -->  "39? That's just 21, in base 19!"

# Translations are welcome!
